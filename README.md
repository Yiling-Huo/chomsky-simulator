# Chomsky Simulator
A game where you get to build grammatical nonsense sentences.

*assets is missing a file (the gensim pre-trained word2vec model). Get a model from gensim in the .txt format [here](https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim-data)*

## version 0.1.0

2024-03-10: Initially created the game.

Known issues: some of the words in the corpus are POS-ambiguous. Game might say ungrammatical when the selected option can work with the sentence as another POS than the game thinks.
